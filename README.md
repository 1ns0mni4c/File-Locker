# Educational Cryptographic File Locker

⚠️ **FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY** ⚠️

## Description

This repository contains a basic implementation of file encryption software written in Python for educational purposes. The code demonstrates fundamental cryptographic concepts and file system operations in a controlled environment.

## Purpose

This project is designed for:

- **Cybersecurity Education**: Understanding encryption/decryption mechanisms
- **Malware Research**: Academic study of file-locking behaviors
- **Security Training**: Helping security professionals understand attack vectors
- **Defensive Development**: Building better protection mechanisms

## Features

- Hybrid encryption using AES and RSA
- File discovery and enumeration
- Multi-OS support
- Completely offline

## Usage

This code should only be executed in isolated, controlled environments such as:
- Virtual machines
- Sandboxed environments
- Dedicated research networks
